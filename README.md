# Efficient clustering 

## TODO

### AFKMC^2 

* Add the possibility to pass an array of random numbers: this is the bottleneck in term of speed. 

### Clustering

* Add a function to compute weights assigned to the centroids. 

### Khorn

* Add the storage order as a template parameter, to allow for matrices stored in column-major.
